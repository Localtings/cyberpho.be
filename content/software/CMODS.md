Hey Assault Cubers,

CMODS is a custom Assault Cube mod loader; made *exclusively* to load all of the Assault Cube mods I've made.

Installation is simple:

1. Download the zip file below
2. Extract it to bin_win32 inside Assault Cube's root directory; a prompt will pop up, asking you whether or not to replace "SDL.dll", choose yes
3. Create a new folder called "cmods" inside Assault Cube's root directory (not the bin_win32 folder you've just been to) and put all of your .dll mods files there

Download through ssh:

scp anonymous@server.cyberpho.be:~/files/CMODS.zip [Your directory]

Any password is valid :P
Remember to run the command in PowerShell if you are on Windows.
